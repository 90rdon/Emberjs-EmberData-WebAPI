# Hunter Warfield

Hunter Warfield has requested to have the ability to review debtor information from their Titanium system for clients stored in their Dynamics CRM. This feature would be used by any user with access to client data. The users will need to be able to read data as well as update some of the data. Debtor data will never be stored in the Dynamics CRM system.
